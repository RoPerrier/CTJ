This folder contains tests and data concerning error counts with set perception thresholds for the following elements:
[('black', 0), ('g1', 160), ('g2', 106), ('g3', 209), ('g4', 80), ('g5', 135), ('white', 255)].
Tests were performed for thresholds of 30, 60, and 90. 
The algorithms were allowed a maximum of 200 iterations, excluding calibration iterations, with a minimum required accuracy of 0.95.
