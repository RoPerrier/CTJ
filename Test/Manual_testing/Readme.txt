This folder includes the assessment of all algorithms by 10 judges, using the following dataset:
[('black', 0), ('g1', 160), ('g2', 106), ('g3', 209), ('g4', 80), ('g5', 135), ('white', 255)].
Each algorithm was allowed up to 30 iterations, not counting calibration iterations, and had to achieve at least 0.9 accuracy.
