Project Name: Comparative Triple Judgment (CTJ) Package

Copyright 2024 Kevin Kelly
Copyright 2024 Romain Perrier

This product includes software developed at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) during an internship,
implementing three distinct algorithms for research purposes: the Adaptive Comparative Judgment (ACJ),
the Rubric, and the Comparative Triple Judgment (CTJ).

The Comparative Triple Judgment Algorithm (CTJ) was devised by Dr. Kevin Kelly, a researcher at TCD.
If you use the CTJ algorithm in your research or software, please cite Dr. Kevin Kelly.
